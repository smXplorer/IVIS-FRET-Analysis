# IVIS-FRET-Analysis
A LabVIEW software to analyze 3-cube IVIS data using sensitized emission FRET equations

This program requires the LabVIEW Development Environment as well as the Vision Development Module Toolkit, both commercial products from National Instruments to be run. It has been developed with LabVIEW 2021 SP1 64 bit on Windows and should run with newer versions of LabVIEW as well.
It depends on the OpenG Toolkit which is freely available online (https://www.vipm.io/package/openg.org_lib_openg_toolkit/).

To run the software, navigate to the CalcX\IVIS FRET folder and double-click the IVIS FRET Analysis.lvproj file (or open it from within LabVIEW).
This will open the project.
The software is run from IVIS FRET_Main.vi (double-click on it in the project window: this will launch it right away).

The software come with bare bone instructions in the lower corner of the window, and has some context help accessible via the 'Ctrl+H' shortcut.
